# QNMexample
Example code to assess and visualize Summerhayes and Elton's Bear Island food web

This code starts with output from Mental Modeler (www.mentalmodeler.org) to assess a modified version of Summerhayes and Elton's (1923) Bear Island Arctic food web.

This code uses the R packages:
- LoopAnalyst
- QPress (install.packages("https://www.rforge.net/QPress/snapshot/QPress_0.21.tar.gz"))

It also relies on Dia (https://sourceforge.net/projects/dia-installer/) to translate network documentation for QPress.
